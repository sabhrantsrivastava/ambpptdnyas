                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">In 1959, when he was 65 years old, Avatar Meher
                            Baba established the Avatar Meher Baba Trust. Its purpose was to provide for his disciples
                            who were dependent on him, and to care for his future Tomb and his property at Meherabad,
                            near Ahmednagar Maharashtra State, India. Meher Baba also specified in the Trust Deed that
                            after he had passed away the the Trust should maintain and care for his Tomb at Meherabad,
                            create facilities for pilgrims there, foster spiritual and cultural activities relating to
                            the spreading of his message, and carry out certain charitable activities for the benefit of
                            humanity irrespective of caste, creed, religion, sex or nationality. It was also to provide
                            training in the spiritual life. All this was to be done in a spirit of selfless service
                            inspired by love for God. God, Baba said, is in each and everyone.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">Baba signed the Trust Deed on 6 April 1959 on
                            Meherabad Hill. The Trust was inactive for the remaining ten years of his life, but he
                            encouraged the trustees, who were his close disciples, to meet intermittently on trust
                            matters. In the 1960s, he gave certain instructions to them for the future about spiritual
                            training and educating the public about his life and message. These were later incorporated
                            into the Trust Deed.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">On June 17th, 1967, Baba executed His Last Will
                            and Testament, in which He bequeathed His property, tangible and intangible. In His Will
                            copyright receives more attention than any other topic.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">After Baba passed away in January 1969, the Trust
                            began to function actively for the first time. Soon after, the charitable, public aspects of
                            the Trust became the Avatar Meher Baba Perpetual Public Charitable Trust, and the private
                            provision for the disciples became Avatar Meher Baba Trust (referred to in the Trust Deed as
                            'Firstly').</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">In the years since, Meherabad and Baba's nearby
                            home called Meherazad have become places of pilgrimage for people from all over the world.
                            (Meherazad was incorporated into the Trust in 1999.) Free clinics, a hospital, a school, a
                            library, museum and study hall, a veterinary clinic, and a variety of accommodations for
                            visitors have been established at Meherabad in accordance with Baba's wishes. This has been
                            made possible through donations given in love by Baba's followers from many countries and
                            walks of life.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">The atmosphere of Divine Love at Meherabad and
                            Meherazad has inspired countless artistic celebrations of love for God through music, dance,
                            plays, story-telling, poetry, painting, videos, and films. These have all been encouraged by
                            the Trust as Meher Baba directed.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">Mani S. Irani, Baba's sister and intimate
                            disciple, was the Trust's chairman for over 20 years. After her passing in 1996, Bhau
                            Kalchuri, another of Baba' s close disciples, became chairman and served until his passing
                            in October 2013.</p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">In December 2013, a new chairman, Shridhar
                            Kelkar, was selected by the Board of Trustees of the AMBPPC Trust. In February 2014, two
                            trustees, Jal Dastoor and Jangu Sukhadwala, were re-elected to serve as trustees up until
                            their term limits, and in March, a new trustee, Merwan Dubash, was selected. These
                            selections were made in conformity with new balloting procedures set down beforehand by the
                            Board under the Trust’s Rules and Regulations. To see the list of Board members and the
                            balloting procedures, go to: <a href="#">Board of Trust</a></p>
                        <p class="content" style="text-align: justify">Recently the Trust created a long-term
                            development plan for Meherabad to preserve the special atmosphere around Baba's Tomb while
                            meeting the needs of an ever-increasing number of pilgrims. The plan for Meherabad Hill was
                            approved in the 1990's. The Development Plan for all of Meherabad was initiated in the late
                            1990's. Long-range plans are also being formulated for his home at Meherazad, particularly
                            creation of a park-like environment around the property with gardens and amenities for
                            visitors, as well as facilities for Meherazad's charitable activities.</p>
